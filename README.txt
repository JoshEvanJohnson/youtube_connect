RO's Youtube Connect allows you through some simple settings to display a page 
built and updated by working within your youtube pages. Simply setup playlists 
within your youtube account, connect with your channel name and the plugin will 
populate those videos names and thumbnails grouped by playlist. You can add a 
showcase video in the settings using the videos unique id.
